1.0 Breaking Changes
===================
This document will outline the breaking changes that are being
introduced into the Docker Cookbook as they are merged into master.

It is a work in progress. Edit me!

Current Interface
===================

### Recipes
#### ```docker::default```
Yields a running Docker service.

- sets sysctls
- creates graph dir
- compile time case logic around install_type includes recipes for
  storage drivers, prerequisite packages, and cgroupfs.
- includes install_type recipe
- includes group recipe
- includes init_type recipe

Recipes for storage drivers exist, creating dependencies, are not used
by default, and have deprecation warnings all over the code. README
explains that they are optional prerequisites for docker::default.

### Attributes
Attribute are set in the key space node['docker'].

- arch - computed from automatic (ohai) attributes
- group_members - []
- init_type - value_for_platform
- install_type - value_for_platform
- install_dir - computed from install_type
- ipv4_forward - bool
- ipv6_forward - bool
- logfile - nil
- version - use by?
- alert_on_error_action - interesting
- dependency_packages - value_for_platform_family
- binary - subkeys calculate version, store binary checksums and urls.
- package - subkeys action, distribution? name->value_for_platform,
  and apt repository information
- source - source install info
- many more that correspond to docker CLI options. Much deprecation. wow.
- host - DEPRECATED for bind_socket/bind_uri
- storage_type - DEPRECATED
- tls - various

These are apparently for internal consumption by cookbook resources..
I'm not currently sure what they do.

- docker_daemon_timeout
- container_cmd_timeout
- container_init_type - computed from init_type... does what now?
- image_cmd_timeout
- registry_cmd_timeout

### Resources
#### ```docker_image```
TODO: blah blah blah
#### ```docker_container```
TODO: blah blah blah
#### ```docker_registry```
TODO: blah blah blah

### Dependencies
- 'apt' - # marked deprecation
- 'aufs', '>= 0.1.1' # marked deprecation
- 'device-mapper', '>= 0.1.0' # marked deprecation
- 'git' - for source installation
- 'golang' - for source installation
- 'homebrew' - ?
- 'iptables' - # marked deprecation
- 'lxc', '>= 1.1.6' # marked deprecation
- 'modules' - # marked deprecation
- 'runit' - # runit init_type
- 'sysctl' - various
- 'yum-epel' - package install_type

Future interface
================
#### Attributes
- Remove mandatory use of node attributes as input. Databags are very
  popular, and it should be easy to use things like Zookeeper, Consul,
  Etcd, or SQL databases to drive settings.

- Attributes can still be utilized by recipes by passing them
  into docker_whatever resources as properties.

- YTBD - what attributes be in 1.0?

#### Resources
### docker_service
- A ```docker_service``` resource (docker_daemon?) will formalize the
  interface and provide input sanitation. Service management will be
  sub classed by init_type ala mysql/httpd.

- Sysctl settings should be set by init providers. Ideally this should
  be handled in scripts / unit files, so that docker can come back up
  on a reboot without a chef-client run.

- Decouple storage driver prerequisites from ```docker_service```.

- Decouple iptables. It should be included by default in the distros.

- Remove LXC support

- install_type support - YTBD. Start with binary, sort
  package/source/homebrew out later.

### docker_image
YTBD - docker-api?
### docker_container
YTBD - docker-api?
### docker_registry

#### Recipes
- WORDS GO HERE

Upgrade Path
================
- Upgrading from 0.x to 1.0 - Supported at all?
